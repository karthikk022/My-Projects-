## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Quick Setup
```bash
# Make setup script executable and run it
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

### 2. Manual Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm run install:all

# Configure environment
cp server/.env.example server/.env
# Edit server/.env with your API keys

# Start backend
cd server && npm run dev

# Start mobile app (in new terminal)
cd mobile && npm start
```

### 3. Required Environment Variables
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ai-super-app
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here
```

## 🔗 API Endpoints Ready

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login  
- `GET /api/auth/profile` - Get user profile

### Chat & AI Agents
- `POST /api/chat/message` - Send message to AI agents
- `GET /api/chat/agents` - Get available agents
- `POST /api/chat/handoff` - Switch between agents

### User Management
- `GET /api/user/dashboard` - User dashboard data
- `PUT /api/user/favorite-agents` - Update preferences
- `POST /api/user/addresses` - Manage addresses

## 🎯 Example User Flows

### Food Ordering Flow
```
User: "Order me pizza"
→ Foodie AI activates
→ "Where are you located?"
→ Shows nearby pizza places
→ User selects restaurant
→ Browses menu, adds to cart
→ Completes order with saved payment
→ Real-time order tracking
```

### Ride Booking Flow  
```
User: "Book cab to airport"
→ RideNow AI activates
→ "When do you need the ride?"
→ Shows available ride options
→ Compares fares and times
→ Books ride with driver details
→ Live ride tracking
```

### Agent Switching
```
User: "I'm hungry but also need a ride"
→ AskMe AI: "I can help with both!"
→ "Would you like to order food first or book a ride?"
→ Seamlessly hands off to appropriate agents
→ Maintains context across agents
```
